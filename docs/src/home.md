## Introduction 

Differential equations-based model is a theoretical approach to explore the phenomenon in real world with mathematical expressions. By integrating theory and empirical knowledge, this approach has been applied to multiple fields including economics, mechanics, electronic circits epidemics and biological systems to provide explanation of the dynamic process and prediction. 

Exploring the steady states of ODE in given domain.
